# 📘 VocabDB: SQL Word Logic Sandbox

This repository is a hands-on T-SQL playground for working with words.  
The project loads 10,000 English words into SQL Server, cleans and structures them, and sets the stage for exploring creative string-based problems — from finding anagrams to building custom text functions.
